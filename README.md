## Google PageRank

***PageRank*** is an algorithm used by ***Google Search*** to display websites in their search engine results based on the rank of each website. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
